Project Workflow & Agile Guidelines
1. Our Agile Methodology
We follow an Agile methodology inspired by Scrum. Our goal is transparency, regular feedback, and the ability to adapt to change.

Sprint Cycles: We operate in 2-week sprint cycles.

Sprint Goal: Each sprint begins with a clear goal (e.g., "Launch V1 of the billing page").

Backlog: The Product Owner maintains a prioritized Product Backlog in Jira.

2. Sprint Ceremonies
Attendance at all ceremonies is mandatory for the entire development team.

Sprint Planning: (Monday, 10:00 AM, 2 hours)

The team reviews and selects high-priority stories from the backlog.

We break down stories into sub-tasks and add time estimates (Story Points).

Daily Stand-ups: (Every day, 10:00 AM, 15 mins)

Held to sync progress. This is not a status report for managers.

Be prepared to answer:

What did I complete yesterday?

What will I work on today?

What blockers are in my way?

Sprint Review / Demo: (Final Friday, 3:00 PM, 1 hour)

The team demonstrates the "Done" work from the sprint to stakeholders.

Sprint Retrospective: (Final Friday, 4:00 PM, 1 hour)

A private team meeting to discuss what went well, what didn't, and what we can improve for the next sprint.

3. Task Management in Jira
Single Source of Truth: All tasks must be created and tracked via our Jira board. If it's not in Jira, it's not being worked on.

Ticket Status: You are responsible for keeping your ticket status up-to-date.

To Do: Ready to be picked up.

In Progress: You are actively working on this.

In Review: You have submitted a PR and are awaiting review.

Done: The PR is merged to develop and passes all checks.

4. Development & Branching
Branching: Always create a feature branch from the develop branch. Never commit directly to develop or main.

Commit Messages: Every commit must reference a Jira ticket ID.

Good Format: [JIRA-123] Add user validation to login endpoint

Bad Format: fixed bug

Pull Requests (PRs):

Fill out the PR template completely, explaining what you changed and why.

Tag at least one teammate for a code review.

Do not merge your own PR without explicit approval.

5. Definition of "Done" (DoD)
A ticket is only considered "Done" when it meets all of the following criteria:

Code is successfully merged into the develop branch.

Merge to main only after passing all CI/CD checks (linting, unit tests, integration tests).

The code is reviewed and approved by at least one other developer.

All acceptance criteria on the Jira ticket have been met.

Any related documentation (e.g., API docs) has been updated.
